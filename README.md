# Lutris
This is my Lutris Install Script Repository

## Purpose
This was designed to place all install scripts in the same place for installing Lutris.
This came about because of the amount of issues people have been having and I wanted,
to create a unified place for placing install scripts.

### [Ubuntu Install Script](UbuntuLutrisInstall.sh)
This Install script will Install Lutris on any Ubuntu System.

### [Ubuntu Uninstall Script](UbuntuLutrisUninstall.sh)
This Script Uninstalls Lutris from any Ubuntu system
<!-- Remember when you use Linux Don't Panic!-->
